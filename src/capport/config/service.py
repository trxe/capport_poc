ServiceRegistry:

The services should be singletons that are globally accessible. I have some code 
that does similar stuff already but it's literally from my work.

for now the service.yml is just an example and i didn't fill out with any 
concrete service initialization args, but those args should be parsed and
directly passed into the Service singleton class.

The implementation is more important for the services, please check the 
./services/* folder.
